# Development Environment

## Intent
Containerized development tooling that can integrate with a minimal amount of host-installed dependencies. For instance, the `dev-container` workflow for vscode integrating and handling git credentials is a nice mechanism for not needing to copy credentials into the container or multiple places.

## Requirements
1. Replicate everyday development tooling to a container
2. amd64 and arm64 support
3. Compose file for development server - hosting multiple services

## Tooling
TabbyML for coding assistant
